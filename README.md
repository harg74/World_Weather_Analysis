# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

With this project you can apply analysis, visualization and statistical skills while learning how to retrieve specific data through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), specifically with the Open Weather Map and Google Maps APIs.

## Process and Results:

### 1. Retreive information from Open Weather Maps API and CitiPy module:

In order to get our random coordinates (latitudes and longitudes) we used ```np.random.uniform``` function to generate them. These coordinates are the ones that are going to be used to find the nearest city with the help of the CitiPy module and construct our dataframe and export it into a csv file for further use.

See full code here: ---> [https://github.com/harg74/World_Weather_Analysis/blob/main/Weather_Database/Weather_Database.ipynb]

```
#Create a set of random lats y lngs combinations

lats=np.random.uniform(low=-90.000, high=90.000, size=2000)
lngs=np.random.uniform(low=-180.000, high=180.000, size=2000)
lat_lngs=zip(lats,lngs)
lat_lngs

```

### 2. Filter by preferred cities by Maximum Temperature:

Once we retreived our random coordinates, we applied a filter for the cities that had a temparature above 70ยบ F, but below 95ยบ F and store them in a data frame.

### 3. Add marker layer with gmaps:

Based on the coordinates and preferred temperatures we iterate over our first dataframe and added a Hotel Name column, based on the nearest city, within a radius of 5,000 meters with gmaps.

```

# 6a. Set parameters to search for hotels within 5000 meters

#dictionary to drop the rows with no Hotel Name.
hotels_no_name=[]

params = {
    "radius": 5000,
    "type": "lodging",
    "key": g_key
}

# 6b. Iterate through the hotel DataFrame.
for index, row in hotel_df.iterrows():
    lat= row['Lat']
    lng=row['Lng']
    
    # Add the latitude and longitude to location key for the params dictionary.
    params["location"] = f"{lat},{lng}"

    # 6c. Get latitude and longitude from DataFrame
    hotel_df[["Lat", "Lng"]]
    
    # 6d. Set up the base URL for the Google Directions API to get JSON data.
    base_url = "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/nearbysearch/json"

    # 6e. Make request and retrieve the JSON data from the search. 
    hotels = requests.get(base_url, params=params).json()
    
    # 6f. Get the first hotel from the results and store the name, if a hotel isn't found skip the city.
    try:
        hotel_df.loc[index, "Hotel Name"] = hotels["results"][0]["name"]
    except IndexError:
        pass
        print('IndexError',index)
        #indexes rows to be dropped with no Hotel Name
        if index not in hotels_no_name:
            hotels_no_name.append(index)

print(hotels_no_name)
hotel_df

```

After these lines, we added a marker layer for each city found with all the cities available to vacation, based on the random coodrdinates.

### 4. Select four cities to vacation and make an itinerary:

Finally, we selected four random cities to plan a vacation and randomly selected four Brazil's cities. Below is the itinerary which starts and end in Santa Maria, Brazil.

1. Start at: Santa Maria
2. Visit Tapes city
3. VIsit Rio Grande
4. Visit Cidreira
5. End at: Santa Maria

With the use of waypoints we were able to map the driving route to visit these four cities:
